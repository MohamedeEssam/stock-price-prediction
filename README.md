## Project Overview

This passage discusses the use of financial models and machine learning in predicting stock prices. Investment firms, hedge funds, and individuals use historical stock prices and company performance data to build machine-learning algorithms for understanding market behavior and making profitable investments. While some believe that stock prices are random and unpredictable, top firms still hire quantitative analysts to build predictive models. The prevalence of software-driven orders on Wall Street and the increasing presence of machine-learning experts highlight the shift toward algorithm-based trading.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Closing Price v/s Time
<br>

We can see from the above graph that Telsa shares have tremendous growth in the 2020-2021 period.
<br>
If we follow the news, it can be due to

1. Emission Credit Sales
2. Tesla entering the Fast-Growing Compact SUV Market
3. Starting production in China

For the rest of the Companies, we can see that COVID-19 is the primary factor affecting the 2020-2021 period.
